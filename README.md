# Algebra in Lean
This is a result of trying to learn theorem proving and functional programming in the [Lean language](https://leanprover.github.io/about/). In the beginning I plan to write mainly algebra theorems. That way I won't have to deal with the definition of real numbers. The goal is to be able to prove simple theorems from
* Group theory
* Number theory
* Linear algebra
