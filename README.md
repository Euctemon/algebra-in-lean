# Algebra in Lean 4
This is a result of trying to learn theorem proving and functional programming in the [Lean language](https://leanprover.github.io/about/). In the beginning I plan to write mainly algebra theorems. That way I won't have to deal with the definition of real numbers. The goal is to be able to prove simple theorems from group theory, number theory and linear algebra. I want the files to be self contained as much as possible. That means I do not use much from the standard Mathlib library. Also the port of Mathlib from Lean 3 to lean 4 is not yet finished.
# Issues
* Currently I have little idea about type classes and overloading. That means I do not use the number 1 which is defined for *Nat* and *Int* types somewhere in Mathlib for the definition of the group identity element but literal word 'id'. I also ran into a problem with the \* operator for the group structure so I use the $$\otimes$$ symbol for the group operation. I think this notation does not trick one into thinking that the structure represents solely multiplication group as the number 1 and the *mul* operation would.
