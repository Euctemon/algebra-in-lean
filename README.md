# Proofs in Lean 4
This is a result of trying to learn theorem proving and functional programming in the [Lean language](https://leanprover.github.io/about/). Originally I thought that I would be able to formalize a couple of basic theorems from a given branch of math but this goal is not currently feasible. It therefore contains various basic proofs about subtraction, few group lemmas or division theorem for natural numbers. Maybe one day this repository will contain enough proofs in order to split it in some meaningful parts.
